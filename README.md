# Supplementary files for RTG Seminar on Continuum Mechanics 
Hold at Portland State University in spring 2025.

In this repository all code examples used in the seminar are made publicly available. To run the files locally you have to install the open-source finite element library [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org) (see the [installation instructions](https://docu.ngsolve.org/latest/)). Then open content/index_seminar.ipynb to start.

You can also run the files directly in the browser
